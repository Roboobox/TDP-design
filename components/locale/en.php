    "road2Title3" => "Contact with programming",
    "road2Content3" => "To improve my coding knowledge, I tried to look at various tutorials on the Internet, but unfortunately it seemed very complicated and I did not have much success. However, it did not diminish the interest in the subject, and around this time I first saw my father's colleague's work as a programmer creating a website that seemed interesting. Due to the fact that I didn't have much success myself, I temporarily discontinued to learn programming and even forgot about it a bit.",

    "road3Title2" => "Difficulties",
    "road3Content2" => "Of course, with the increasing complexity, not everything was so simple, as well as attending courses after school, when there was already a relatively high level of fatigue, which made the learning process in extra-curricular activities a bit more difficult.",
    "road3Title3" => "New knowledge",
    "road3Content3" => "Despite the difficulties, I was not particularly worried about them, because around this time I had already gained some knowledge to try to create small programs on my own and also to look at them in courses with teachers, which completely confirmed my interest in programming.",
    "road3Title4" => "Future and high school",
    "road3Content4" => "Around this time, my plans for the future began to be serious about programming and I began to think about further education in the technical school after elementary school, but one of the course teachers suggested that the technical school would not be so useful after these courses and also suggested a better high school and program to learn.",

In the beginning, because of the new program I had to spend a lot of time learning to keep up with the new level.",
    "road5Title2" => "IT subjects in high school",
    "road5Content2" => "In high school, however, I could already see that I did great in subjects like computer science and programming, and these were definitely my favorite subjects, which only intensified my desire to in future learn more about these skills and theory at university.",

    "road7Title1" => "Admission to university",
    "road7Content1" => "After applying to the university and graduating from high school, there was a registration competition. Enrollment in the competition at the Faculty of Computing of the University of Latvia was easier because of the high school choice, which resulted in relatively good exam results, as well as previous work and projects, which helped to make sure that I had chosen the right direction and program.",
    "road7Title2" => "Beginning of studies",
    "road7Content2" => "When I started studying at university, I was quite interested in most of the courses, as well as over time studying at university and attending internship, I have become more aware that I like to use and learn web technologies the most.",
